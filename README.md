its a macro of key/mouse done in win api (windows only) - no this is not a efficient program, if someone cares about a feature not here, a request can be made.

This is soley made by me - which I will not identify unless required

the terms of program modifying/use:
1. just refrence me when using or modifying the program, never claim it is your code base... fairly simple terms


Feature request: just ask for it as a github issue and I will answer the question and implement the feature; not that people would care about my program too much 



oh yeah, the program is in the repository (it's the exe)
